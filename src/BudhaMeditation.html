            <h2 class="">With the growing number of dealing with stress and anxiety related challenges, most health-conscious people are becoming more aware and interested in addressing their mental well-being and clarity.</h2>
            <h2 class="">Buddhist meditation practice has a lot of benefits, such as:finding inner peace, helping to increase focus and attention, fight stress, be more creative, and so on.</h2>
            <h2 class="">However, for some people it's not always possible to go to meditation centers or classes to attend sessions. We wanted to understand what are the challenges around the practice of meditation that people have, and create an experience to solve those challenges.</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h2 class="">understanding the problem</h2>
            <h2 class="">Stress, frustration, mental chatter, and similar terms just casually slip into the conversations of modern-day individuals. And to that, the influence of the pandemic, and it is the right time for us to blow off our minds.</h2>

            <h2 class="">Well, stress and moodiness are just the tips of the iceberg There are underlying issues that are deep-seating in the mind of individuals, and constant restlessness is the new normal. We do not want that. Actually, nobody wants that. And so, to keep calm amidst the chaos, individuals are gravitating toward mental fitness applications.</h2>

        </section>
        <section class="col-span-7">
          <h2 class="">In this project, we tried to design an innovation solution platform that targets users who are busy, lazy people, who may even been haunted by the wish to do the meditation practice, and encourages them to commit to a healthier lifestyle. The challenge allowed for creative freedom to decide which area of wellness to tackle (within the defined six dimensions of wellness listed by NWI: emotional, occupational, physical, spiritual, intellectual, and social) while also considering those who are new to Buddhist practice. Based on some of the most important, fundamental Buddhist principles - the Buddhist view, practice and action.</h2>
          <h2 class="">Measuring the ROI of influencer marketing is challenging. Viewing the content and creator performance metrics, compiling all the usual suspects like impressions, reach, views, and engagement rate, as well as influencer's very own impact rate.</h2>
