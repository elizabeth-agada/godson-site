            <h2 class="font-bold">Simplicity is strength</h2>
            <p class="">As a designer, we are often lured by attractive, trendy and out of the box designs. But, we must always remember the 'why.' The primary goal is to understand the user, their problems and then come up with a design that solves it.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold">Prioritize</h2>
            <p class="">Create a strategic plan to launch an MVP. This helps deal with out-of-scope requests that could potentially derail the project and helps deliver a quality product in time.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold">Seek out feedback early and continually</h2>
            <p class="">The trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism. Keeping the stakeholders/users in loop and testing solutions in whatever form (paper, low-fi or hi-fi) as early as possible saves ample amount of time and re-work.</p>
